1. Describe how your prefetcher works.

2. Explain how you chose that prefetch strategy.

3. Discuss the pros and cons of your prefetch strategy.

4. Demonstrate that the prefetcher could be implemented in hardware (this can be
   as simple as pointing to an existing hardware prefetcher using the strategy
   or a paper describing a hypothetical hardware prefetcher which implements
   your strategy).

5. Cite any additional sources that you used to develop your prefetcher.
